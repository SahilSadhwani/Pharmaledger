The Problem in current pharmaceutical supply chain is lack of end to end visibility, security, trust and traceability.The actors involved in the supply chain cannot completely guarantee the authenticity of drugs and thus the patient at the end is the victim of any faulty/fake drug supplied.
Blockchain will provide secure transactions among the stakeholders of the system and all the necssary details about orders and medicines will be stored on blockchain.
IoT will help verify the authenticity of drug which will increase the rust among the stakeholders and it will also keep track of the temperature in the surroundings of the drug and can also keep the track of location of the drug which will connect the physical and information flows of the supply chain making every order trackable and secure. 
So our system stores all necessary orders data on blockchain between stackeholders such as Manufacturer, Wholesaler, Retailer, Customer.
For all orders and all medicines qr will be generated based on a hash and these qr's will be tracked throughout the supply chain. 
A stakeholder when receives medicines scans all qr and only original one's and unique one's are accepted.
